AI Travel & Flight Tracker Agent

An AI-powered multi-agent system that helps users plan their trips intelligently ‚Äî combining real-time flight tracking, hotel recommendations, weather forecasting, and AI-based conversation using LLMs (Groq, Gemini, etc.).

 Key Features

 AI Agents with Specialized Roles

Flight Agent ‚Äì Finds and tracks flight details using AI-based reasoning.

Hotel Agent ‚Äì Recommends top-rated and budget-friendly hotels near your destination.

Weather Agent ‚Äì Predicts weather conditions for your travel dates using real-time weather APIs.

(Coming Soon) Budget Planner & Transport Route Agent for complete travel assistance.

 Multi-LLM Support

Supports Groq API, Google Gemini API, and WeatherAPI for intelligent, fast, and reliable responses.

Secure Configuration

Uses .env file to safely manage all API keys and credentials.

 Modular Architecture

Each agent is independent and easily replaceable ‚Äî you can plug in new APIs or AI models without affecting the rest of the system.
