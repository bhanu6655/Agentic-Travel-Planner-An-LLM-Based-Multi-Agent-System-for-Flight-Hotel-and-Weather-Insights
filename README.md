AI Travel & Flight Tracker Agent

An AI-powered multi-agent system that helps users plan their trips intelligently ‚Äî combining real-time flight tracking, hotel recommendations, weather forecasting, and AI-based conversation using LLMs (Groq, Gemini, etc.).

 Key Features

 AI Agents with Specialized Roles

Flight Agent ‚Äì Finds and tracks flight details using AI-based reasoning.

Hotel Agent ‚Äì Recommends top-rated and budget-friendly hotels near your destination.

Weather Agent ‚Äì Predicts weather conditions for your travel dates using real-time weather APIs.

 Modular Architecture

Each agent is independent and easily replaceable ‚Äî you can plug in new APIs or AI models without affecting the rest of the system.

|              AI Travel Agent             |
+------------------------------------------+
|  Flight Agent       Hotel Agent      |
